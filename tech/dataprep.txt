# File defining operations for dataprep
# Format:
# <operation> <source layers> <destination layers> <sizing amount in microns>
# Operations supported: add,sub
#   add: Create a region from all shapes of the source layers and combine this region with each destion layer region separately
#   sub: Same as add but don't build combination but cross-section instead
# Sizing amount uses the klayout sizing operation to size the regions of the source layers
# During dataprep the regions are merged, meaning overlapping polygons will become one Polygon
# source/destination layers are separated by commas if there are multiple
# Each argument is separated by white spaces. How many should not matter as they will be parsed by a python str.split() operation which should be able to handle any white space amount.
# If the first word of a line is not a supported operation the line will be ignored
# The lines will be executed in order meaning and add sub operations on layers will be different than a first sub and then add
